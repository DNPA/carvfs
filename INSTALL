The CarvFS filesystem  has the following prerequisites:

* cmake.
* libcarvpath development files
* fuse development files.

To build the user space filesystem run:

  cmake src
  make

To install the user space filesystem use the following command:

  sudo make install


This version of LibCarvPath has been tested to run on 64 bit x86 linux.
There should however be no reason why it should not run just as well on 
other systems that support FUSE.

Note: There is also a 'configure' file. "DON'T USE IT". Its there only for people who don't
      read files like this one, so they have a good change of getting everything build when
      blindly using 'configure','make','sudo make install'. This subproject uses the cmake
      build system.
